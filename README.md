Advice: we all need it in all domains of life and we all give it. But sometimes, maybe most times ‚Äì at a crossroad, or dilemma, or embarrassing life situation, or when we‚Äôre stuck ‚Äì we need a REAL person to talk to. And after all that we learn through our experiences, we become experts in a few areas and get to help others.

Delphe creates room for an online global community just for you to connect with, and only one ask away! You can sign up to be an asker or an expert, and beginning getting the answers you need or answer questions by topics you know well!

# APIs -UPDATE

## Firebase

üö´Replace text below with a description of the API

Firebase is an API that lets developers easily sync and store data in realtime. Firebase Simple Login is an additional service that allows developers to authenticate users using only client-side code. Enable authentication via a number of third-party providers, anonymous login, or email / password authentication without having to manually store authentication credentials or run a server.

## Stripe

üö´Replace text below with a description of the API

Stripe is a service that allows users to accept payments online, specifically developers. The Stripe API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs. 

## Websocket

üö´Replace text below with a description of the API

You can do anything your heart can imagine. In life you need colors. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there.


# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Environment Variables -UPDATE

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:


    *  REACT_APP_API_KEY - this is your Google API key, which can be generated in the Google Cloud Console

    *  REACT_APP_DOMAIN - when you set up your Firebase project, this information will be in the dashboard

    *  REACT_APP_backendURL - optional for your local development 

# 5Ô∏è‚É£ Content Licenses -UPDATE

üö´For all content - images, icons, etc, use this table to document permission of use. Remove the two placeholders and add you content to this table

| Image Filename | Source / Creator | License                                                                      |
