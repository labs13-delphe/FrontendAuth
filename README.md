Advice: we all need it in all domains of life and we all give it. But sometimes, maybe most times ‚Äì at a crossroad, or dilemma, or embarrassing life situation, or when we‚Äôre stuck ‚Äì we need a REAL person to talk to. And after all that we learn through our experiences, we become experts in a few areas and get to help others.

Delphe creates room for an online global community just for you to connect with, and only one ask away! You can sign up to be an asker or an expert, and beginning getting the answers you need or answer questions by topics you know well! 

_"Creating a community for knowledge seekers to connect with experts in a variety of fields."_

## Tech Stack

### Front end built using:

#### React JS


-    Allows application creating using multiple reusable components to cater to multiple users 
-    Improves efficiency and scalability of application

#### Material UI
-    Provided a solid design framework for application
-    Provided reusable and customizable components


#### Front end deployed to Netlify

#### [Back end](https://github.com/labs13-delphe/backend) deployed to Heroku and built using:

#### Node JS + Express

-   allows us to build a relational database using knex and sqlite.
-   allows us to create out own middleware wherever neccessary.
-   allows for easy integration with our React app.
-   allows us to create modular, RESTful APIs to call on from our React app.


# APIs -UPDATE

## Firebase

Firebase supports authentication using passwords, phone numbers, popular federated identity providers like Google, Facebook and Twitter, and more. For the purposes of our app we limited the types of authenitcation to google and email. We then used part of the google object returned after authenitcation to connect our node.js users table to our authentication for a clean user flow throughout the app. We build out our own backend because Firebase does not support SQL relational databases. 

## Stripe

Stripe is a system that enables a developer to implement a complicated and secure payment infastructure in their app. We strategically integrated stripe into our app for use on a future messenger and zoom integration release of the Delphe product. It would allow experts to request payment for consultation given.

## Websocket (Future Release)

Websocket is a computer communications protocol that allows for duplex communcation channels over a single TCP connection. 

## Zoom (Future Release)

Zoom would allow us to inegrate video conferencing calls into our app for face-to-face consultations between novices and experts for a fee collected through Stripe. 

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Environment Variables -UPDATE

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:


    *  REACT_APP_API_KEY - this is your Google API key, which can be generated in the Google Cloud Console

    *  REACT_APP_DOMAIN - when you set up your Firebase project, this information will be in the dashboard

    *  REACT_APP_backendURL - optional for your local development 

# 5Ô∏è‚É£ Content Licenses -UPDATE

üö´For all content - images, icons, etc, use this table to document permission of use. Remove the two placeholders and add you content to this table

| Image Filename | Source / Creator | License                                                                      |
